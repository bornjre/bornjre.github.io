<h1>Totality</h1>
<p>
  There is a concept in computer security called an attack vector, which refers
  to specific points in a system from which an attacker can exploit
  vulnerabilities or weaknesses. To explain this using an analogy of a house,
  someone could enter the house from various places like the door, window, or
  cat door. These are the attack vectors of the house. The concept of an attack
  vector is a type of totality, where totality refers to the complete or
  comprehensive nature of something, considering all aspects or elements.
  Achieving totality in real life is much harder. In the example of a house, a
  SEAL team could bust through the house by jumping down from a chopper. At this
  point, you might be asking what the point of being pedantic like this is
  because the concept of totality can be used as a thinking tool in different
  fields.

<p>Let's imagine the components that affect a person's health:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Environment</li>
  <li>Diet</li>
  <li>Genetics</li>
  <li>Habits</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Then, a study reveals that there are bacteria living in your gut, and the type
  of gut bacteria is associated with different diseases and a person's health.
  It's like discovering a whole new attack vector that we didn't know about
  before.
